# Patcher

This patcher allows us to accept contributions for the JavaDocs on the Hytale Server API without needing to publish the decompiled code.

## Contributing

1. Decompile the server jar in `/work/decompile`
2. Run the `applyPatches.py` file to apply the current patches
3. Make any changes you wish to the code such as adding new documentation etc.
4. Run the `makePatches.py` and commit that code to your fork.
5. You can now make a PR and get these patches merged to the repository.
